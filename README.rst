XML

XML reader with a SimpleXML like API. Used internally by other arbit
sub-projects. Should probably not used anywhere else.

Building / Testing
==================

To build the project just type::

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    ant

The first two commands are only needed when building for the first time. The
``ant`` command should run the tests and all verifications.
